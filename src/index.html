                In Vietnamese, the word “Bánh” means kind of bread, but it could be used to refer the baguette of Vietnamese or the sandwich, and the word “Mì” means the wheat.

        <section id="history">
            <h2>The History Of Bánh Mì</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of Bánh Mì can be traced back to Vietnam's colonial period under French rule which lasted from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century. One of the culinary foods from this time is the introduction of French baguette. The French has brought the bread to Vietnam, but for the first time, the baguette was eaten with butter, pâté, and other European ingredients. After that, Vietnamese people adapted the baguette and turned it into their unique version of the bread – now it is called Bánh Mì. Instead of the traditional French fillings, Bánh Mì was combined with the natural ingredients of Vietnamese people such as carrot, cucumber, cilantro, and a variety of proteins, from pork to tofu. The bread itself was modified to be lighter, with a crispier crust than the French baguette.            
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time, it began with humble street food, but now it has become more popular and appears in luxury restaurants, casual eateries, and street vendors. Whether you love spicy, sweet, or savory, Bánh Mì has it ready to serve you. Due to the fact that Vietnamese people settled in a lot of countries, especially the USA, Canada, and Australia, Bánh Mì began to appear in these in the early times.
